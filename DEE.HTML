            <H1>Urvashi is in Hyderabad for film's shooting</H1>
           <h3><p>
            The Telugu film also stars Nandamuri Balakrishna, Dulqueer Salman and Bobby Deol. Tentatively titled NBK 109, the film went on floors
             in November 2023. Directed by Bobby Kolli, the music in the film is by Thaman S. The release date of the film hasn't been released yet.</h3></p>
          <h3><P>Cyberabad houses more than 100 large IT/ITeS and BFSI companies, and employs nearly one million people. The Hyderabad Knowledge 
            City developed at Raidurgam is a new feather in the cap of this bustling area. Even though there are constant infrastructural upgrades to the area, it has been found that there is a lack of communal space for the burgeoning young population residing there. In order to provide a more engaging environment to the residents there,
             the Telangana Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TGIIC) has initiated a project that will embody the spirit of Cyberabad</h3></P>
           <h3><p>TGIIC is the nodal agency responsible for planning, development and maintenance of industrial infrastructure
             and allied facilities across the state. For this project, the TGIIC has invited consultancy proposal for architectural and 
             transaction advisory services for development of T-Square at Raidurgam. The corporation has stated that its aim is to develop this 
             intersection as a major tourist destination with vibrant urban spaces and entertainment hub. It will be a collaboration zone and commercial intersection to bring people together.</H3></P>
